# Kali-
Kali+ is just a post installation of Kali 2.0 with fixes and add-ons
1. Use lazykali as base
2. automatically install the hackpack from lazykali repos or just make a folder and auto git clone  it.
3. Add Lee Bairds discover + install
4. Add Pedro Ubuntu's netool.sh + install
5. Any other ideas?
